                HTML 5 Darg and Drop

                        Usability, an important part of web interface eases the way we communicate with web. Many new technologies and functionalities
                        are invented to ease the development effort as well as improve the overall way in which users interact with web.

                        HTML5 has given many things as of today to improve the browser functionalities on client side with minimum amount of
                        scripting. It provides a great way to implement drag and drop functionality in modern browsers. We are going to see how it is
                        implemented with a basic example of dragging and dropping a image from one div to another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve drag and drop functionality with traditional HTML4, developers would have to use complex Javascript code. HTML
                        5 provides a Drag and Drop<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dnd">API</a>  that brings support to the browser making it much easier to code up. No extra plugins needed to
                        be installed. It is supported by the following major browsers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Internet Explorer 9+</li>
                        <li>Firefox</li>
                        <li>Opera, Chrome</li>
                        <li>Safari</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                Note: Drag and drop does not work in Safari 5.1.7 and earlier versions.
            </ul>

                HTML5 File Upload Example
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In this example we well explain how to use HTML 5, to read information about file(s) selected by users, and to upload the file(s) on
                        a server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The File<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">Api</a> is one of the most interesting features added with HTML 5. Now we can display file(s) information before they are
                        uploaded on the server, and we can send them without "posting" a form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We well see how to access file(s) information when they are selected by users, and then upload them asynchronously using an Ajax
                        Request.
